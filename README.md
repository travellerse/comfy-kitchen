Each of the eight rope entries also has an in-place form (`apply_rope_`,
`rms_rope_split_half1_`, ...) with the same backend coverage as the row above.

## HIP backend (AMD RDNA2 / RDNA3 / RDNA3.5 / RDNA4)

The `hip` backend implements the quantized paths with its own kernels: WMMA
matrix-core GEMMs on RDNA3/RDNA3.5/RDNA4, and non-WMMA kernels (quantizers,
INT8 dequantizers, RoPE and the fused RMSNorm+RoPE, AdaLN and RMS-AdaLN, the AWQ
GEMV) that also run on RDNA2. It does not link or call hipBLAS/hipBLASLt; every
matmul is compiled from the sources in `comfy_kitchen/backends/hip/`.

Both rope kernels address their inputs through the tensor's own strides, so a q/k
pair permuted or sliced out of a packed qkv is read where it lies rather than
copied contiguous first. The in-place entries (`apply_rope_`, `rms_rope_` and
their split-half and single-tensor siblings) rotate a strided view in place for
the same reason: each thread owns one element pair and loads both before storing
either.

`int8_linear(input_act=...)` folds the activation into the fused ConvRot
quantizer's load, so an MLP's `linear(act(proj(x)))` never writes act's output to
HBM just to read it straight back.

What a GPU gets depends on whether it has matrix cores:

| Generation | gfx targets                 | Matrix cores | What runs                               |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| RDNA4      | `gfx1200`, `gfx1201`        | WMMA + fp8   | All HIP-supported kernels, fp8 native   |
| RDNA3.5    | `gfx1150`-`gfx1153`         | WMMA, no fp8 | All HIP-supported kernels; fp8 widened  |
| RDNA3      | `gfx1100`-`gfx1103`         | WMMA, no fp8 | All HIP-supported kernels; fp8 widened  |
| RDNA2      | `gfx1030`-`gfx1036`         | none         | Non-WMMA kernels incl. INT8 DP4A and W4A4 sdot8 GEMM |

The WMMA-backed fp8, int8 and int4 GEMMs share one byte-addressed tile kernel
(`gemm_wmma.h`); RDNA2 INT8 and W4A4 use the separate DP4A paths in
`gemm_dp4a.hip` and `gemm_w4a4_dp4a.hip` instead. RDNA3 and RDNA4 spread a
WMMA operand across the wave differently and
RDNA3 has no fp8 WMMA (it widens to bf16, which is exact), so each has its own
set of `Mma` policies in `mma.h`; the tile kernel itself is shared.

RDNA2 has no matrix cores. It runs the kernels that do not need them (RoPE,
AdaLN and RMS-AdaLN, the quantizers, stochastic rounding, the AWQ GEMV) plus
INT8 and W4A4 DP4A paths: wave-reduced INT8 GEMV for small M and LDS-tiled
GEMMs otherwise. WMMA-only GEMMs still fall through to triton/eager. In a
process with a mix of GPUs the capability set is the intersection, since
kernels launch on the tensor's own device.

The INT8 DP4A path splits at a per-device GEMV crossover (M <= 16): the small-M
kernel reduces K across the wave and the HIP compiler auto-vectorizes its
packed loads into `v_dot4c_i32_i8`; above it `gemm_dp4a.hip` stages 64x64
tiles through LDS (BK=128, 4x4 register accumulators per thread) and calls
`__builtin_amdgcn_sdot4` explicitly, prefetching the next K tile into per-thread
registers before computing the current tile. Both need K a multiple of 16 and
16-byte row bases: `int8_linear` materializes contiguous INT8 operands with a
K%16 row stride, and explicitly aligns the weight with `_aligned`. The epilogue
is `(acc * scale_a[row] * scale_b[col]) + bias` accumulated in fp32 and written
out as fp32, fp16 or bf16.

The W4A4 path (`gemm_w4a4_dp4a.hip`) reuses the same 64x64 tile, LDS staging
and EpiRowwise epilogue, feeding packed int4 rows (two nibbles per byte, K/2
bytes per row) to `__builtin_amdgcn_sdot8` (`v_dot8_i32_i4`), so no unpack
kernel is needed; it requires K a multiple of 32. On RDNA2
`convrot_w4a4_linear` takes this path, while WMMA architectures keep the WMMA
int4 GEMM.

A request outside a kernel's domain (swizzled operands, scaling other than
tensor-wise, a K that is not a multiple of 16) falls back to torch or eager.
NVFP4 and MXFP8 stay on eager everywhere: RDNA has neither fp4 WMMA nor
microscaling hardware. Set `COMFY_KITCHEN_DISABLE_HIP=1` to remove the backend
from dispatch.

### RDNA2 validation scope

The INT8 and W4A4 DP4A paths were compiled for the full HIP target manifest
and run on real hardware only for RX 6700 XT (ROCm reports `gfx1030`). Other
`gfx103x` targets are compile-validated, not hardware-validated. The INT8 M<=16
GEMV crossover is a benchmark-supported heuristic, not an autotuned optimum.

### Building

On a ROCm-only host, the backend is selected automatically when CUDA's `nvcc`
is absent. Both a system ROCm install and the pip `rocm-sdk` layout (which a
ROCm PyTorch build already pulls in) are detected, so on Linux and Windows alike
the usual build is:

```bash
pip install .
```

No environment variables, `CC`/`CXX` override or Visual Studio developer shell
are needed: the ROCm clang builds C, C++ and HIP alike and locates the MSVC
toolchain itself. CMake >= 3.26 and Ninja are required (Windows only ships a
Visual Studio generator, which has no HIP language support). On Windows the
Microsoft C++ build tools and Windows SDK must be installed, since clang links
against them and CMake compiles a resource file with the SDK's `rc.exe`, which
the build locates itself rather than expecting on `PATH`. Use the Visual Studio
2022 v143 toolset; newer MSVC toolsets are not yet reliable with ROCm.

When CUDA and ROCm toolchains are both installed, the source build defaults to
CUDA only. This avoids compiling an unused multi-architecture HIP binary on an
NVIDIA workstation. Request a combined build explicitly:

```bash
COMFY_KITCHEN_BUILD_HIP=1 pip install .
```

Architectures default to the validated GPUs the build machine can see, or to
every target in the backend's architecture manifest when it can see none (a CI
box), which is what the wheels carry. Detection reads the visible devices
through PyTorch, so under PEP 517 build isolation (a plain `pip install .`) it
sees nothing and falls back to the full target list; set `COMFY_HIP_ARCHS`, or
pass `--no-build-isolation`, to build for the local GPU instead. Building for
one target is much faster:

```bash
COMFY_HIP_ARCHS=gfx1201 pip install .
```

```powershell
$env:COMFY_HIP_ARCHS = "gfx1201"; pip install .
```

`PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` and `GPU_ARCHS` are honoured too. When the build machine sees
AMD GPUs but none is RDNA2/3/3.5/4 (CDNA has MFMA, not WMMA), the extension is
skipped rather than built (seeing no GPU at all falls back to the full target list
above instead);
`COMFY_KITCHEN_BUILD_HIP=1` requests HIP explicitly (and makes an unsupported
visible AMD GPU a hard error), while `COMFY_KITCHEN_BUILD_NO_HIP=1` suppresses
the backend entirely.

Architecture overrides are exact and fail closed. A compiler-recognized target
that is not in the manifest is rejected until its device and WMMA policies have
been reviewed and added.

Both extensions are built against the Python limited API on 3.12+, so a wheel
carrying CUDA and HIP side by side keeps its `abi3` tag. At runtime only the
extension matching PyTorch's CUDA or ROCm runtime is loaded.


## Quantized Tensors

The library provides `QuantizedTensor`, a `torch.Tensor` subclass that transparently intercepts PyTorch operations and dispatches them to optimized quantized kernels when available.

| Layout                 | Format       | HW Requirement  | Description                             |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `TensorCoreFP8Layout`  | FP8 E4M3     | SM ≥ 8.9 (Ada)  | Per-tensor scaling, 1:1 element mapping |
| `TensorCoreNVFP4Layout`| NVFP4 E2M1   | SM ≥ 10.0 (Blackwell) | Block quantization with 16-element blocks |
| `TensorCoreMXFP8Layout`| MXFP8 E4M3   | SM ≥ 10.0 (Blackwell) | Block quantization with 32-element blocks, E8M0 scales |

```python
from comfy_kitchen.tensor import QuantizedTensor, TensorCoreFP8Layout, TensorCoreNVFP4Layout

# Quantize a tensor
x = torch.randn(128, 256, device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
qt = QuantizedTensor.from_float(x, TensorCoreFP8Layout)

# Operations dispatch to optimized kernels automatically
output = torch.nn.functional.linear(qt, weight_qt)

# Dequantize back to float
dq = qt.dequantize()
```

### Requirements

- **Python**: ≥3.10
- **PyTorch**: ≥2.7.0
- **CUDA Runtime** (for CUDA wheels): ≥13.0
  - Pre-built wheels require NVIDIA Driver r580+
  - Building from source requires CUDA Toolkit ≥12.8 and `CUDA_HOME` environment variable
- **nanobind**: ≥2.0.0 (for building from source)
- **CMake**: ≥3.26 (for building from source; the abi3 modules need FindPython's `Development.SABIModule`)

## Quick Start

```python
import comfy_kitchen as ck
import torch

# Automatic backend selection (hip -> cuda -> triton -> eager)
x = torch.randn(100, 100, device="cuda")
scale = torch.tensor([1.0], device="cuda")
result = ck.quantize_per_tensor_fp8(x, scale)

# Check which backends are available
print(ck.list_backends())

# Force a specific backend
result = ck.quantize_per_tensor_fp8(x, scale, backend="eager")

# Temporarily use a different backend
with ck.use_backend("triton"):
    result = ck.quantize_per_tensor_fp8(x, scale)
```

## Backend System

The library supports multiple backends:
- **eager**: Pure PyTorch implementation
- **cuda**: Custom CUDA C kernels (CUDA only)
- **hip**: Custom HIP kernels (WMMA GEMMs on RDNA3/3.5/4; non-WMMA kernels also on RDNA2)
- **triton**: Triton JIT-compiled kernels

### Automatic Backend Selection

When you call a function, the registry selects the best backend by checking **constraints** in priority order (`hip` → `cuda` → `triton` → `eager`):

```python
# Backend is selected automatically based on input constraints
result = ck.quantize_per_tensor_fp8(x, scale)

# On CPU tensors → falls back to eager (only backend supporting CPU)
# On CUDA tensors → uses cuda or triton (higher priority)
```

### Constraint System

Each backend declares constraints for its functions:

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Device** | Which device types are supported |
| **Dtype** | Allowed input/output dtypes per parameter |
| **Shape** | Shape requirements (e.g., 2D tensors, dimensions divisible by 16) |
| **Compute Capability** | Minimum GPU architecture (e.g., SM 8.0 for FP8, SM 10.0 for NVFP4) |

The registry validates inputs against these constraints **before** calling the backend—no try/except fallback patterns. If no backend can handle the inputs, a `NoCapableBackendError` is raised with details.

```python
# Debug logging to see backend selection
import logging
logging.getLogger("comfy_kitchen.dispatch").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
